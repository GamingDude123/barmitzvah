        <p> &ensp;&ensp; Who am I? Mi Ani? This is a question that Moshe asks as he stands before God at the burning bush. Moshe asked this question last week in Shemot, and more fully answers this question in my Parasha, Vaera.<br><br>
            &ensp;&ensp; When Moshe meets God at the Burning Bush, he is already 80 years old. The first part of his life was spent in Pharaoh's Palace, the second part was as a shepherd in Midian. Suddenly God tells Moshe that he has been selected for the most important role in Jewish history. Go to pharaoh, confront him, and lead Israel to freedom. <br><br>
          
            &ensp;&ensp; Moshe may or may not have felt more of a confident leader when he was told that Aharon, his brother, was going to be by his side. God understood that people need someone by their side as a source of support, but he is also helping to answer to his question.  Who am I, Moshe asked, why has God chosen me for this specific role? This is your family, this is your people, this is your story.<br><br>
            &ensp;&ensp;  Moshe is trying to rally the Israelites, ve-lo shamu el Moshe, they did not listen to him, <i>mikotzer ruach umeiavoda kasha</i>,  because of  the brokenness of their spirit, and  their brutal labor.  At this Point Moshe experiences another crisis: not of identity, but of confidence.  He seems to have failed. Moshe thinks God is furious because of his lack of self - motivation to freeing the Israelites out of Egypt. So he turns to God and reveals another insecurity: Hein benei Yisrael lo shamu Elai, behold the Jewish people will not listen to me, ve-eikh yishmaei-ni Pharoah, va-ani sefatayaim, I stutter when I speak, I have a speech impediment.  Moses’ first experience as a leader was failure.  But rightly understood, that is the process of leadership, that is the process of growth.<br><br>  
            &ensp;&ensp;  Moses’ Triumph: the rest of Va-eira From this point onwards in Vaera, Moses overcomes his own lack of confidence and the real plagues begin.  The plagues are no mere punishment of Egypt; they are a challenge to pharaoh claim to be a God, to be worthy of worship, to be entitled to enslave a people Add description of the plagues
            &ensp;&ensp;     By Va-era’s end, the stage is set for the Exodus.  But we know that Moses will face other failures, other setbacks; the golden calf, the story of the spies, and so much else.  But that will not prevent him from leading the people.  That is what leadership is about, that is what life is about.
